London 2019-09-13 Section 1 Prerequisites For best results, the user should have the latest version of R (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) installed. The next step is to install a variet of packages that will be needed for spatial analysis and creating maps in R. We will start with those packages available from CRAN. install.packages(c( &quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;sf&quot;, &quot;devtools&quot; )) Lastly, we will install the ptolemy package which provides access to the Global High-Resolution Geography for shoreline data. This will provide easy access to basemaps of global land masses. The package is not released to CRAN and so we will use devtools::install_github() devtools::install_github(&#39;jmlondon/ptolemy&#39;) # if asked, do not upgrade the rgeos install The ptolemy package needs to download and install the source data before you can access the data. { install-gshhg, eval = FALSE} ptolemy::install_gshhg() At this point, you should be ready to proceed with the examples provided in this book. Each chapter is a separate example and each tries to introduce you to elements of the sf and ggplot2 / ggspatial packages that make importing, manipulating, and creating maps in R relatively easy. "]
